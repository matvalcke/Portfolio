        <div>
            <p>Currently I'm studying web development at My Digital School Lille and I’m in an apprenticeship in Eole Digital, a Web and communication agency.

                Front end, back end are the ways I have chosen to express myself .
                Through php and its framework laravel I have built the foundation and functionality of websites.
                Then with JS, Css and some of their frameworks I bring to life my creativity and  my ideas of animations and design.
                
                </p>

                <p>During my school days I had the opportunity to work on really interesting projects like a facebook look-alike with free reign on the theme.
                    Another example would be a blog about alcohol free drink in collaboration with foreign students from Ireland and Portugal. This project was truly challenging and helped me develop my critical thinking, teamwork and communication skills .
                    What makes me want to work in web development the most is the creation, even if it’s not touchable you can create things that will help, amaze people .
                    My inspiration is to develop something that clients would be happy with. It’s my pride to respond to clients' needs .
